		<h1>XKCD URI OSX</h1>

		<p>An extremely simple OS X app which opens URIs that use the xkcd scheme in your default browser.</p>

		<h3>What?</h3>

		<p>Something like <code>xkcd://201</code>. Apparently that's a thing.</p>

		<h3>Why?</h3>

		<p>The hell if I know. Some iOS apps for reading XKCD (don't even get me started on that) started using it so the comics would open in their app. They're showing up in the wild a bit, and this app just removes the annoyance when you encounter one.</p>

		<h3>How?</h3>

		<p>XKCD URI OS X just tells OS X that it knows how to open that type of URI. When one is clicked the app figures out the real URL for the comic and opens it in your default browser.</p>

		<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Download the latest version <a href="//github.com/rspeed/XKCD-URI-OSX/releases">from Github</a>.</li>
			<li>Unzip the archive.</li>
			<li>Move <code>XKCD</code> to the Applications folder.</li>
			<li>Right-click on <code>XKCD</code> and select "Open".</li>
			<li>When prompted, click the "Open" button.</li>
			<li>After a few seconds, XKCD #353 (Python) will open in your default browser.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Using</h3>

		<p>Just leave it be. If it's doing its job correctly you'll forget it's even there.</p>
