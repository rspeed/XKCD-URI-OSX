		<h1>XKCD URI OSX</h1>

		<p>An extremely simple OS X app which opens URIs that use the xkcd scheme in your default browser.</p>

		<h2>Why?</h2>

		<p>The hell if I know. Some iOS apps started using it and it's seeped out a bit. This app just removes the annoyance when you encounter a link to them.</p>

		<h2>Download</h2>

		<p>[Download link will go here]</p>

		<h2>Using</h2>

		<p>There's nothing to do except have the app on your hard drive. When you click on a link that uses the xkcd scheme, it will simply open the comic in your web browser.</p>
